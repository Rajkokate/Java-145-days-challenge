# Java-145-days-challenge
145 days of challenge for conqurering programming languages with concepts of DSA and OOPS concepts.
Day-4 
it all about diff types of loops 
1. while loop - it will continue runnig until you conditioned it.
2. for loop - in this loop we initiated  condition inside for loop paranthesis
 and after that we run code.
3. do - while loop - inthis loop first operation is done then checking condition of while.
4. also we look some example of question on loops which is mainly asked in interview .like prime no. , reverese number ,print 100 times string.

Day-5
It;s all about Pattern printing the 3 basic rule or criteria we checking during pbasic pattern print
1. check how many time your outer loop will print . (for number of lines)
2. check how many time your inner loops will be run. (for printing chacracter in single line)
3. decide which pattern you want to print . like * or number or char.
   here we building our basic of nested loops concepts.
