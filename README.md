# Java-145-days-challenge
145 days of challenge for conqurering programming languages with concepts of DSA and OOPS concepts.


Day-4 
it all about diff types of loops 
1. while loop - it will continue runnig until you conditioned it.
2. for loop - in this loop we initiated  condition inside for loop paranthesis
 and after that we run code.
3. do - while loop - inthis loop first operation is done then checking condition of while.
4. also we look some example of question on loops which is mainly asked in interview .like prime no. , reverese number ,print 100 times string.

Day-5
It;s all about Pattern printing the 3 basic rule or criteria we checking during pbasic pattern print
1. check how many time your outer loop will print . (for number of lines)
2. check how many time your inner loops will be run. (for printing chacracter in single line)
3. decide which pattern you want to print . like * or number or char.
   here we building our basic of nested loops concepts.

Day-6
It' all about Functions & methods we discuss or learn about creating function with parameters or functions without parameters
1. function without parameters like returntypename(){
                              // body
                         return statement;
                       }
   2. Function with parameterss like returntype(type para1, type para2){
                                       // body
                                 return statement;
                          }
   3. also see some of example for example sum of 2 number & products of 2 numbers using functions.
   4. Also see some memory part in JAVA like in java we know that variables in java occupy memory but also functions occupy memory in form of stack.
   5. Each element in stack is called stack frame . Each function type call from main fun it will stored in memory of stack.
   6. Also see concepts of swapping 2 numbers using logic of temp variable. (logic of 3 buckets)
   7. Most important concepts is j(ava always calls by value) call by reference means when function call in java with some value will be passed so always java pass the copy of value instead of passing original value .
  
   8. Looking forward to calculate binomial coefficient using samelogic of factorial
      simpli replace value in formula = n!/r!(n-r)!
      we calculate all factorial using previous function of factorial and then replace valuse with a, b, c
      i.e. bc=a/(b*c) a=n_fact , b=r_fact , c=fact_(n-r).
  
Day-7
1. Function Overloading - its not depend on return type of function it will depend on parameters of function.
2. example like we write multiply function in this different type of parameters we can use like float int double or multiple values like 2 value multiply or 3 value.


inthis isprime 2 more corner cases made(not checking as normal number )

  we will look this number as condition like num 2. it is alreay prime dont need to check so we write 
  cond'n for 2num
  corner cases - if is not prime then right false here not going to outter loop.(instead of false we have to write 
                    // prime when variable declared.)

Day-8
Its all about advandec pattern printing using concepts of functions methods loops and concepts still we learn.
pattern like rectangle , butterfly , hoollow rectangle, inverted half pyramid.

Hollow rectangle using simple logic of row and columns of matrix.
we simply print boundry cell of matrix to print hollow rectangle.

In this module of advanced pattern we almost learn and code all type of pattern and logics .
for example palimdromw with numbers , pyramid with numbers and spaces .
All the promblem solve with dry run. and only remember that all pattern solve with 3 basics rule 
 a.outer loop b. inner loop c. what should print(num,*)
